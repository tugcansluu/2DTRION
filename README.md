##My 2D Platform Unity Project

In this project, I'm learning how to make a Unity 2d platform game. I'm at the very beginning of the project. If I continue to develop day by day and I like it very much. I would like to release the game.
Here is what I have done right now.

I'm currently using an asset called Sunny Land. Basically I'm working on the design to plan the game, then I plan to design the designs myself and use them instead of the asset.
